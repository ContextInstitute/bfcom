# Bright Future Commons

Bright Future Commons (BFCom) is being developed to serve as an intranet for [intentional networks](http://blog.kumu.io/building-intentional-networks-that-drive-impact-part-1/). [Context Institute](http://www.context.org/about/) is developing it as a platform to provide web support for the [Bright Future Network](http://www.context.org/about/plans/bright-future-network-initial-vision/) (BFNet).

It is a fork of CUNY’s [Commons In A Box](http://commonsinabox.org/), which is built on [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) and [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/), which are in turn built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Like Commons In A Box, Bright Future Commons will consist of a theme and an associated set of plugins— some our own and some developed and maintained by others. Our value-add is in the integration and customization. This is a user-driven project focused on meeting the needs of the Bright Future Network, but we are making it open source since we expect BFCom will be useful for others as well.

Additional information about the project is in the github repo Wiki …

## Status

As a project, BFCom got its start in mid July 2016. Since then we have been gathering a team, doing prototyping and developing design guidelines (please see the Wiki for a [timeline](https://github.com/ContextInstitute/bfcom/wiki/Timeline) and our [public Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0B4UY32-vtSy1ZUV6OWVUUWF4Yms) for details).

As of December 2016, we’re just starting into coding. The files in the repo are the start of the child theme: bfcom-theme. This is still in the early stages of development, not even alpha yet.
